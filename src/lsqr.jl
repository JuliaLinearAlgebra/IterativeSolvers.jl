    lsqr(A, b; kwrags...) -> x, [history]

Same as [`lsqr!`](@ref), but allocates a solution vector `x` initialized with zeros.

"""
    lsqr!(x, A, b; kwargs...) -> x, [history]

Minimizes ``\\|Ax - b\\|^2 + \\|damp*x\\|^2`` in the Euclidean norm. If multiple solutions
exists returns the minimal norm solution.

The method is based on the Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization process.
It is algebraically equivalent to applying CG to the normal equations
``(A^*A + λ^2I)x = A^*b`` but has better numerical properties,
especially if A is ill-conditioned.

# Arguments
- `x`: Initial guess, will be updated in-place;
- `A`: linear operator;
- `b`: right-hand side.

## Keywords

- `damp::Number = 0`: damping parameter.
- `atol::Number = 1e-6`, `btol::Number = 1e-6`: stopping tolerances. If both are
  1.0e-9 (say), the final residual norm should be accurate to about 9 digits.
  (The final `x` will usually have fewer correct digits,
  depending on `cond(A)` and the size of damp).
- `conlim::Number = 1e8`: stopping tolerance.  `lsmr` terminates if an estimate
  of `cond(A)` exceeds conlim.  For compatible systems Ax = b,
  conlim could be as large as 1.0e+12 (say).  For least-squares
  problems, conlim should be less than 1.0e+8.
  Maximum precision can be obtained by setting
  `atol` = `btol` = `conlim` = zero, but the number of iterations
  may then be excessive.
- `maxiter::Int = maximum(size(A))`: maximum number of iterations.
- `verbose::Bool = false`: print method information.
- `log::Bool = false`: output an extra element of type `ConvergenceHistory`
  containing extra information of the method execution.

# Return values

**if `log` is `false`**

- `x`: approximated solution.

**if `log` is `true`**

- `x`: approximated solution.
- `ch`: convergence history.

**ConvergenceHistory keys**

- `:atol` => `::Real`: atol stopping tolerance.
- `:btol` => `::Real`: btol stopping tolerance.
- `:ctol` => `::Real`: ctol stopping tolerance.
- `:anorm` => `::Real`: anorm.
- `:rnorm` => `::Real`: rnorm.
- `:cnorm` => `::Real`: cnorm.
- `:resnom` => `::Vector`: residual norm at each iteration.
